    about:
      "Our story began in 1942, when a young Don Julio Gonz√°lez saw a unique opportunity in the production of tequila. He didn't have much, but what he did have was passion, and after sharing his vision with a powerful local businessman he was granted a loan to create his first tequila distillery. It was this unrelenting passion for excellence that inspired his creation of the world's first luxury tequila.",

      "Clase Azul Reposado is an ultra-premium reposado tequila made with Tequilana Weber Blue Agave that is slow cooked in traditional stone ovens for a minimum of 72 hours. Once the agave reaches a deep, rich flavor, it is fermented with proprietary yeast prior to distillation. Once the tequila is distilled, it is aged for 8 months in hand-selected oak barrels. This process results in a superb, smooth taste which exceeds expectations with each sip.",

    about: "Clase Azul Mezcal Guerrero reveals one of Mexico's best-kept secrets: the wondrous state of Guerrero, a little-explored region that shows us another facet of Mexican culture. This new member of the Clase Azul family was inspired by the singularity of Guerrero's landscapes, gastronomy, art, and heritage - but also by the strength and leadership of the women of this region. Mezcal Guerrero is a truly unique piece. Beyond its beautiful decanter, its majestic flavor comes from a very rare variety of agave: the papalote agave. This plant grows wild in the Mountain Range of the State of Guerrero, where the notes combine the sea's climate and flavor with the green forests' freshness. The decanter is an artisanal piece that pays tribute to the ancestral wisdom, tender nature, and warrior spirit of the Mexican woman-qualities that have made her the heart of Guerrero's culture. The green color represents jade, a precious stone with extreme value to our ancestral cultures and a symbol of eternity. The 4-petaled flowers covering the decanter represent the Fifth Sun-a pre-Hispanic god known as the beginning of everything. The colorful cap features a hummingbird's figure, reaffirming its mystical and celestial connection to this Mexican region.",
